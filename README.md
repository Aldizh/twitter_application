twitter_application
===================

This is an application that lets user follow locations, post and run queries using that information!
Guideline to detach an existing repo and push to a new one to gihub:
1.  rm -rf .git => Detaches the application
2.  git init
3.  git remote add --track master origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git => adding remote tracking branch
4.  git  pull
5.  git push origin master
